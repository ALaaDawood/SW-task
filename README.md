## Overview

A single page web application made using Angular7, it takes a string in a form input
and search for people using this string input in this public API https://swapi.co. 
The retrieved results then are rendered as cards where each card has the characterâ€™s details (Name,
URL, height, homeworld).
Also, the user can drag and drop the rendered cards to reorder them on screen.

### search Approach

To implement the search feature I could use two ways :
1. Use the Api url https://swapi.co/api/people/ which gets a list of **all** people and then make my search query inside this list by filtering it to the elements containing the search term only.
2. Use the Api url https://swapi.co/api/people/?search=r2 which just takes the search term as a parameter in the url, filters the people
and returns a list with **only** the filtered people.

## How To Run

If you want to run the example locally,

* clone this repository
* Run `npm install`
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Running unit tests

* Run `npm test` to execute all the tests

## Used tools and Frameworks

* Bootstrap 4
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) 
* FontAwesome for icons
* Angular CDK

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploy

for deployment, we need to For create a production build and then copy the output directory (by default dist folder) to the web server.

1. Run the production build command: `ng build --prod`
2. Copy everything within the output folder (dist) to a folder on the server.
3. Configure the server to redirect requests for missing files to index.html.
